## Technologies and Practices Used
1. **HTML**

   - **`alt` Attribute**: Implemented the `alt` attribute in images for better accessibility for visually impaired users.

2. **CSS**
   - **Flexbox**: Used flexbox to create an adaptive layout structure, allowing elements to adjust smoothly within the container and respond correctly to screen size changes.
   - **Media Queries**: Implemented media queries to ensure responsive design, adapting styles for various screen sizes for user convenience on mobile devices.
   - **Typography**: Incorporated custom fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the aesthetic of the design, with various font sizes and line heights to improve text readability.

3. **Accessibility**
   - **Accessibility Attributes**: Used attributes such as `role` and `aria-label` to enhance content accessibility.
   - **Color Contrast**: Ensured sufficient contrast between text and background for easier reading.

4. **Project Structure**
   - **Clear Code Organization**: Organized code into logical sections for better readability and maintenance, with class names describing element purposes.
   - **Modularity**: Used classes for styling different elements, allowing easy modifications without disrupting other parts of the code.

5. **Responsiveness**
   - **Adaptive Cards**: Configured quote cards to switch to two columns on screens smaller than 800 pixels and one column on even smaller screens for mobile convenience.

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - **Testing**: Conducted tests on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure correct display and functionality.
